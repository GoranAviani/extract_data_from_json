Extract data from json <br/><br/>

This script is used to extract specific data from json located in a file.
Next step that this script does is it saves the extracted data in a new file with every record in a new line.<br/>
Reason to make this script is because MySQL versions < 2.7 dont have a way do do it on its own.
